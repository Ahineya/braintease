Totally—you can keep it simple and skip “true” virtual registers. Do a spill-only, physical-register codegen with a tiny allocator. It’s a classic, robust bring-up strategy and works great on your ISA.

Minimal, spill-only register scheme (no vregs)

1) Pick a tiny calling convention & reserved regs
   •	R0: hardwired zero (never allocate)
   •	RA/RAB: link regs (set by JAL, consumed by JALR r0,r0,RA)
   •	SB: stack bank register (constant for the stack bank)
   •	SP: stack pointer
   •	FP: frame pointer
   •	GB (optional): global/rodata bank register
   •	Scratch: keep R12 for address math/spill helper

Allocatable pool for expressions/temps: R3..R11 (adjust if you want a bigger scratch set).

2) Frame layout (no analysis needed)
   •	Locals & spills live in the stack bank at [SB : FP + offset].
   •	Prologue (per function):

; assume SB already = stack bank
ADD   R15, R14, R0          ; FP = SP
ADDI  R14, R14, -FRAME_SIZE ; SP -= size


	•	Epilogue:

ADD   R14, R15, R0          ; SP = FP
JALR  R0, R0, RA            ; return



3) Tiny “allocator” (greedy + spill)

You only track physical regs in a small free list.
•	getReg() → pop from free list; if empty, spill one (LRU or “furthest next use” if you have that info; otherwise just LRU).
•	spill(reg):

; store reg -> [SB : FP + spill_off]
ADD   R12, R15, R0
ADDI  R12, R12, SPILL_OFF
STORE reg, SB, R12

Keep a table: which reg is spilled to which slot.

	•	reload(reg) (when you need it again):

ADD   R12, R15, R0
ADDI  R12, R12, SPILL_OFF
LOAD  reg, SB, R12


	•	freeReg(reg) → push back to free list (and clear “spilled?” bookkeeping).

Across a JAL: conservatively spill all allocatable regs that are live (easiest: spill all non-empty regs right before emitting JAL). Later you can track “live” flags to avoid spilling dead ones.

4) Expression codegen without vregs

Emit code directly to physical regs using a depth-first walk and the Sethi–Ullman number to avoid spills:
•	need(node):
•	leaf (const/variable/pointer): 1
•	unary: need(child)
•	binary:
•	if need(L) == need(R): need = need(L)+1
•	else: need = max(need(L), need(R))
•	Always evaluate the subtree with larger need() first. That minimizes peak regs.

Templates
•	Load local variable at FP+off:

ADD  r, R15, R0
ADDI r, r, off
LOAD r, SB, r


	•	Store local:

ADD  R12, R15, R0
ADDI R12, R12, off
STORE rVal, SB, R12


	•	Binary op rd = a (+) b (both already in regs):

ADD rd, ra, rb   ; or SUB/AND/OR/XOR/SL/SR


	•	Immediate const:

LI r, imm


	•	Address-of & arrays:
	•	&x → compute FP+off into a reg; the pointer value is that address in the stack bank.
	•	*(p) → LOAD rd, SB, p if p is a stack pointer; for globals use GB instead of SB.
	•	*(p + k) → ADDI p2, p, k*WORD_SIZE; LOAD rd, SB, p2.

(You can keep it bank-agnostic by tagging each pointer value with its “bank” at compile time: for stack locals use SB; for globals/rodata use GB. Then you just pick the right bank register in LOAD/STORE.)

5) Control flow (no liveness needed)
   •	Conditions: compute into a reg rx, compare with zero using branches.

BEQ rx, R0, else_label


	•	Loops: labels + branches. Free any temps at statement boundaries.

6) Calls (super simple)
   •	Spill all temps (greedy).
   •	Evaluate args left→right (or your chosen order), place them where your ABI expects (e.g., pass on stack or in R3..R6).
   •	Emit:

; JAL bankImm, addrImm  (your format uses immediates for calls)
JAL  0, func_addr


	•	Return value convention: pick a register (e.g., R3) for integer return; callee writes it; caller reads it.

If the callee needs callee-saved registers, just don’t allocate them (keep your pool caller-saved only). That avoids prologue save/restore complexity entirely.

7) Example: compile t = (a+b)*(c+d)

Assume locals at FP offsets: a@+0, b@+2, c@+4, d@+6, t@+8, free list = {R3,R4,R5,R6,...}

; load a
get R3
ADD  R3, R15, R0
ADDI R3, R3, 0
LOAD R3, SB, R3

; load b
get R4
ADD  R4, R15, R0
ADDI R4, R4, 2
LOAD R4, SB, R4

ADD  R3, R3, R4       ; R3 = a+b
free R4

; load c
get R4
ADD  R4, R15, R0
ADDI R4, R4, 4
LOAD R4, SB, R4

; load d
get R5
ADD  R5, R15, R0
ADDI R5, R5, 6
LOAD R5, SB, R5

ADD  R4, R4, R5       ; R4 = c+d
free R5

MUL?  (no MUL in base ISA)
; expand to loop or repeated add, or use your IR lowering to a sequence
; if you stick to base ops, emit a small multiply routine call:
;   move args to ABI regs, JAL mul_helper, result in R4

; Here assume we have a primitive:
;   (if not, substitute with your add/shift loop)

; result in R3 = (a+b) * (c+d)

; store t
ADD  R12, R15, R0
ADDI R12, R12, 8
STORE R3, SB, R12
free R3, R4

(If you don’t have MUL, your front-end should lower * to a small helper that uses only 2 temps; the simple allocator still works.)

8) Arrays, strings, pointers (M3 scope)
   •	p = &arr[0] → ADD p, FP, 0 + base_off
   •	*(p+1) → ADDI tmp, p, 1*WORD; LOAD rx, SB, tmp
   •	Globals: preload GB with global bank; emit LOAD/STORE rx, GB, addr.

9) Error-free by construction
   •	Because you never keep values live across statements (except explicit pointers/locals you reload), you dodge complex lifetime bugs.
   •	The worst that happens when you run out of regs is a spill—which is correct by design.
