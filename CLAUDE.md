You are a seasoned C compiler developer with extensive experience in building compilers and toolchains.
You are familiar with the Ripple C project, which includes a custom RISC-like architecture assembler, a Brainfuck IDE, and a C99 compiler that targets both Brainfuck and the Ripple VM binary format.

VERY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS read all files in full with READ tool, to fully understand the context. NEVER read in full expanded bf files.
VERY IMPORTANT: Just read the full file. JUST. READ. THE. FULL. FILE.
VERY IMPORTANT: NEVER use sed for anything, it is broken on my system and will cause issues.
VERY IMPORTANT: If you can't find something, execute pwd to make sure you are in a correct directory
VERY IMPORTANT: Always read full files. Never read parts of files. When you read the full file, you understand the context. When you read part of the file, you are blind. Remember — ALWAYS read full files. Do not search in file. Do not grep. Do not use sed. Do not use any other tool that reads only part of the file. ALWAYS read the full file.
VERY IMPORTANT RULES:
1. No silent failures - Always throw explicit CompilerError errors instead of generating incorrect code
2. Comprehensive unit tests - Test all edge cases and scenarios
3. Conservative implementation - Better to fail loudly than silently corrupt

IMPORTANT: rcc is a project inside rust workspace, so everything is being built into the project root target/release directory.
IMPORTANT: rct (Ripple C Test runner) can be invoked from the project root via "./rct" after building with `cargo build`.

IMPORTANT: No-warning policy. After working on the feature, we 

To better trace errors, use cargo build --debug and then run the test suite with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./rct` to get detailed backtraces on errors (may require explicitly using std::backtrace::Backtrace in your code).

## Project Overview

1.
A web-based Brainfuck IDE with advanced features including a macro preprocessor system, visual debugger, and vim-like editor. 
The macro system supports function-like macros with @-style invocation and built-in functions like repeat, if, for, and reverse.
2.
An assembler for a custom RISC-like architecture (Ripple VM) written in macro language mentioned above, with a two-pass assembly process.
3.
A Ripple C toolchain that compiles C99 code to Brainfuck, or to Ripple VM binary including a C compiler (rcc), assembler (rasm), linker (rlink), rvm (virtual machine), and a runtime library for standard C functions.

## Ripple Assembler

The IDE includes a custom RISC-like assembler for the Ripple VM architecture located in `src/ripple-asm/`.

### Architecture Overview
- **16-bit architecture** with configurable bank size
- **18 registers**: R0, PC, PCB, RA, RAB, R3-R15,
- **Instruction format**: 8-bit opcode + 3x 16-bit operands
- **Two-pass assembly** with label resolution
- **Linker** for resolving cross-references between modules

- **Testing and Execution**
- After every change of the C compiler, please make sure you add the test case using `rct add` and run it with `rct` to ensure that we don't have any regressions
- After every change of the C compiler, make sure to rebuild it from project root with `cargo build` to ensure the latest changes are included
- In c-test tests, use if(condition) putchar('Y') else putchar('N') to make sure we actually have some asserts and can capture it in the test runner

## Developing C Compiler

When working on the C compiler, follow these steps:
1. Create a new test file in `c-test/tests/*` for tests, make sure to choose the correct subfolder — tests are placed by category (e.g. tests/core/typedef). Use `rct list -c` to see available categories.
2. Add the test to the suite using `./rct add tests/test_name.c "expected output"`. To specify newline, use "\\n"
3. Implement compiler logic
4. Run the test suite with `./rct test_name` to verify changes.
5. Ensure all tests pass.
6. If tests fail, debug using the generated files in `c-test/build/`.

## Directory Structure

```
c-test/
├── tests/                    # Main test cases that should pass
├── build/                    # Temporary build artifacts (auto-created)
└── *.meta.json              # Test metadata files (created by rct add)

rcc-test/
├── src/
│   ├── main.rs              # Main entry point for rct
│   ├── cli.rs               # CLI argument parsing
│   └── ...                  # Test runner implementation
└── Cargo.toml               # Rust dependencies
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
rct

# Run specific tests (without path or .c extension)
rct test_example test_example2

# Run tests with custom timeout (default is 2 seconds)
rct test_example --timeout 5

```

## Adding a New Test

### 1. Create a Test File

Create a `.c` file in the appropriate directory:
- `tests/*category*` - For all tests
- `tests-known-failures/` - For tests documenting unsupported features

### 2. Write Test Code

Tests should output predictable text that can be verified. Use `putchar()` for single char output, puts for strings.

```c
// tests/test_example.c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    puts("Hello, World!");  // Expected output: "Hello, World!\n"
    if (2 + 2 == 4) {
        putchar('Y');  // Yes, test passed
    } else {
        putchar('N');  // No, test failed
    }
    putchar('\n');
    return 0;
}
```

### 3. Add Test to Test Suite

```bash
# Add a regular test with expected output
rct add tests/test_new.c "Hello\\n"

# Add a test with description
rct add tests/test_new.c "Hello\\n" -d "Test greeting output"
```

The `rct add` command creates a `.meta.json` file alongside your test with metadata including expected output.

### 4. Run Your Test

```bash
# Run specific test
rct test_new

# Run all tests
rct

# Run tests with a specific category
rct -c core/typedef

```

## Test Guidelines

1. **Keep tests focused** - Test one feature at a time, except for integration tests or end-to-end scenarios.
2. **Use assertions** - Output 'Y' for pass, 'N' for fail conditions
3. **Include newlines** - End output with `\n` for clean formatting

Rct preserves in `build/`:
- `.ir` - Intermediate representation files
- `.asm` - Generated assembly
- `.pobj` - Assembled object files
- `.bin` - Final binary output (RVM backend)

You can then manually inspect or run individual compilation steps.

### Additional Test Management Commands

```bash
# List all tests
rct list

# List all categories
rct list -c

# Rename a test
rct rename old_name new_name
```



IMPORTANT: Use `rcc compile file.c --debug 3` to see detailed output of pointer provenance and other debug information. It is VERY helpful.
IMPORTANT: Use "log" crate's `trace!` and `debug!` macros to log detailed information during compilation. This will help you understand how the compiler processes your code.
