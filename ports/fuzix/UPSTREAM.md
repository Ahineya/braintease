The **complete, unmodified archive** is committed in `vendor/`. The portable
working tree in `upstream/` contains the kernel C sources, kernel/device headers,
minimal memory-allocation stub, selected application sources, portable library
routines/headers, README, credits, version, and licenses used by this port. This avoids losing upstream `.S`/`.s` pairs on macOS filesystems and
avoids treating upstream's tracked generated assembly as ignored local files.
To explore/build other upstream platforms, extract the full archive on a
case-sensitive filesystem. No network fetch is required to build this port.

Adaptations to files that exist in the archive are recorded in `upstream.patch`,
with paths relative to `upstream/`. Hunks omit context; use
`git apply --unidiff-zero` when replaying against the pristine archive. The kernel changes cover block/directory C16
layout, scalar user-memory validation, integer formatting, durable sync/error
handling, panic shutdown, the complete 32-bit `sbrk` return value, and clearing
recycled inodes before a pipe can reinterpret a deleted device number as a block.

`Library/libs/qsort.c` selects its specialized element paths using C `sizeof`
instead of physical-octet constants. Utility changes add bounded recursive
`mkdir`/`rm`, standard `cut` option parsing, error statuses, trailing-word counts,
`head -n`, missing-operand guards, C16 dump/usage calculations, and matching
format widths. Original copyright and license notices remain with imported
sources; newly rewritten adaptations are marked as such.

`Applications/util/vile.c` uses a direct ANSI terminal backend on Ripple, with
validated dimensions, alternate-screen cleanup, and bounded storage compatible
with its signed 16-bit movement offsets. Adaptations also bound file reads,
remember names supplied to `:w`, and mark backspace-only edits as modified.
Ctrl-C cancels raw-mode input, while `ed` supports the standard `Q` discard/quit
command. The upstream `tcgetattr`/`tcsetattr` wrappers are reused. `vile.doc` is retained
as upstream's historical document; current supported usage is in this port's
README.

Ripple ABI headers, syscall/stdio/format/allocator/directory support, the small
shell, platform drivers, and build/image tools live in `ripple/` and `tools/`.
The executable list is defined by `APPS` in the port Makefile and exported to
`build/apps.json`. This remains a curated userspace port; the complete archive
also contains applications and libraries that are not built yet.
